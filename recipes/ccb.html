    <h3>What is Chicken Cordon Bleu?</h3>
        <p> A crispy, succulent, perfectly-fried piece of fried chicken. But we also love gourmet meals. You know, the ones that you sit down to in the candlelight? Those ones. Well, our easy chicken Cordon Bleu is the best of both worlds: sounds fancy but really? It’s just some really, really good fried chicken. That, we can promise. </p>
        
    <h4>Ingredients - 6 Servings</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
                
            <li>Pepper</li>
                
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                
            <li>16 slices swiss cheese</li>
        
            <li>½ lb ham, thinly sliced</li>
            
            <li>peanut oil, or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
                
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder, tossing to coat evenly. </li>

            <li> On a cutting board, place a chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound until about ½ inch (1 cm) thick with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or heavy pan. </li>

            <li>Remove the plastic wrap and place 2 slices of Swiss cheese, then 2 slices of ham, then another layer of Swiss cheese, and another layer of ham. Evenly roll the chicken and place onto a new sheet of plastic wrap.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a tall-sided pan with 2 inches (5 cm) of oil to 325°F (170°C).</li>

            <li>After the rolls are set, prepare 2 separate large, wide dishes with the flour, beaten egg, and bread crumbs. Dredge the chicken first in the flour, then the egg, and then bread crumbs.</li>

            <li>Place the breaded chicken cordon bleu in the oil and cook for about 5 minutes per side, or until the outside is an even golden brown. If a good color is achieved and the chicken’s center is still not 165°F (75°C), place the chicken cordon bleu on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and finish the chicken in the oven at 325°F (170°C) until that temperature is reached.</li>

        </ol>
